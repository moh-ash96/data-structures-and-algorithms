# ll-Insertions

I was asked to append values at the end of a linked list, and also have a function that takes two arguments, one that we will insert the other argument after, and another function that also takes two arguments but puts the value before the first argument

## Challenge

The challenge is getting to merge two functions which are find and insert.

## Approach & Efficiency

    O(n) for time and space for the three of functions

## Whiteboard
