# ll-Insertions

I was asked to append values at the end of a linked list, and also have a function that takes two arguments, one that we will insert the other argument after, and another function that also takes two arguments but puts the value before the first argument

## Challenge

The challenge is getting to merge two functions which are find and insert.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- for the insertion I used O(1) method which inserts at the beginning of the list
and for the includes method, i used Traversal

O(n) -->

## Whiteboard
