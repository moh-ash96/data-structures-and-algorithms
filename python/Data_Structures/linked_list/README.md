# linked list

I was asked to create a linked list that I can insert into, check a value inside, and it should return a string of contents

## Challenge

The challenge is that it is a new thing to know, I even don't think I completely get it, but it will get better

## Approach & Efficiency

for the insertion I used O(1) method which inserts at the beginning of the list
and for the includes method, i used Traversal

O(n)

## API

* Insert a node in front of the linked list.
* Search for a specific node in the linked list.
* Return a sequence of the Linked list contents.
