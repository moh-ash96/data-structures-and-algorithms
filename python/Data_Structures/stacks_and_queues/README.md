# Stacks and Queues

I was asked to create a stack that I can push into, pop from, check if empty, and peek from.
And create a queue that I can enqueue into, dequeue from, check if empty, and peek from.

## Challenge

The challenge was in testing them to decide which will be viewd first and which will removed first.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used a O(1) for all of the methods.

## API

### Stack

* Initiate a stack.

* Push into it.

* Pop from it.

* peek from it.

* Check if empty.

### Queue

* Initiate a queue.
* Enqueue.
* Dequeue.
