# ll-zip

I was asked to take two linked lists as arguments and merge them together.

## Challenge

The challenge is that I need to go through two lists and work with them as iterable lists and take the values into a new list

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O Notation:
O(N) --> time
O(1) -->space

## Whiteboard
