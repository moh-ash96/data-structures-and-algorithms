We brought "4"
and "8" to the pivot's  left, and "16", "23", "42" to its right and assigned "4" and "16" as the new pivots.

## The Third step

We brought "4" to the left of "8" and "42" is the pivot now.

## The Fourth step

Here "23" is less than "42" so it is in it's right place.

## The Fifth step
