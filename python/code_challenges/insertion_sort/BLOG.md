# Insertion sort

## The original input

## The First Step

![1st](/Assets/insertion/1st.png)

here the first element '**8**' was larger than the second one '**4**' so they swapped.

## The Second Step

![2nd](/Assets/insertion/1st.png)

here the second element '**8**' was smaller than the third '**23**' so nothing changed.

## The Third Step

![3rd](/Assets/insertion/3rd.png)

here the function checked for the smallest number '**15**' and swapped it with the third number '**23**'.

## The Fourth Step

![4th](/Assets/insertion/4th.png)

The function checked for the smallest number again '**16**' and swapped between it and the fourth number '**42**'

The Fifth Step

![5th](/Assets/insertion/5th.png)

The function has left two elements to check, which are '**42**' and '**23**', and since '**23**' is smaller than '**42**' they swapped
